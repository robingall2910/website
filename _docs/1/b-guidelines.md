Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
We have these rules for both our server and forum.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary.

### Server guidelines
Our server tries to maintain freedom and equality for all members.
To keep that freedom, we must create rules that seperate right and wrong on our server.

- **Don't harm the server.** - Don't deliberately lag, crash, or corrupt the world in any way. We have plugins to prevent lag, but only perform massive edits with the permission of an administrator. Deliberately lagging, crashing, or corrupting the world in any way is forbidden. Don't attempt to weaken the server's response time with lag machines; and don't corrupt the game by using exploits such as chests and other various blocks. Flooding any chat with messages using plain text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed. The same goes for bot accounts, fake members that join the server to spam or lag us. Advertising isn't allowed in the main chat.

- **Don't harm others.** - Respect the wishes of others by giving them privacy. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to simply stay away from them so you don't anger them further. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed. Administrators are capable of rolling back any grief using a block logging tool. Don't 'troll' others or use derogatory remarks; such as comments that are potentially sexist, racist, homophobic, or directed to offend someone. Don't use hacks or exploits that can annoy others, such as potions or mobs.

- **Don't be malicious.** - Hacked clients are allowed, but only if they don't harm the server or other players. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to malicious, pornographic, or hateful content in chat. Committing rogue activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their `tptoggle` without consent from that member. Attempting to frame people with false reports (including administrators) is forbidden and administrator reports should be made through the website.

- **Don't plagiarise.** The act of invading other's builds or using someone else's schematics without permission from the original creator is forbidden. Taking credit for the builds of others isn't allowed unless the responsible architect allows you to do so. Although you can download any schematic from the server, respect the wishes of others by not uploading their content to sites.

- **Don't bypass ban.** - You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine administrators by ignoring or blocking them. Don't use other services such as Dynmap to appeal your ban. Instead, you can use the website to file an appeal.

- **Use common sense.** - Don't use offensive tags or nicknames designed to offend. Threatening harm to yourself or other members, including suicide-related threads, will result in an immediate suspension. If an administrator doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned in our guidelines. It's important to use common sense at all times.
 
## Forum guidelines
As with our server, we prefer to maintain freedom of speech on our forum.
That being said, regulations are necessary to keep discussions in order.
Our forum guidelines also apply to the general website and Discord server.

- **Don't spam or power-post.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason. Try not to make whole new posts simply for the sake of adding on to something you posted earlier. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses (people usually make a post to say 'yeah' or agree with somebody). If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading.

- **Don't make discussions with the wrong tag.** Flarum uses a tag system so members know which posts are about what. This allows somebody with specific knowledge to answer posts quickly and filter out what they don't want to read. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant. Don't add irrelevant tags to attract people's attention, your post may end up getting deleted.

- **Don't start spam discussions.** This would be a discussion simply made for the sake of spamming, also known as 'shit-posting'. Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Threads like these will be removed.

- **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on.

- **Don't evade suspension.** If you're subject to a suspension then you may not create an account. Remember, anyone (an account or not) can read documentation. If you already had an account prior to the suspension, it will be restricted.

- **Don't plagiarise.** If you don't already know the definition, plagiarism is copying someone else's work and calling it your own. Posts can be deleted for plagiarism.

- **Adhere to copyright.** Don't post anything against copyright law on the forum. We are based in the United States, so we follow U.S. law. Your post will be removed if it violates copyright and (if needed) you will be reported to the proper authorities.

- **Keep control of your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. If your account is hijacked, it is your responsibility to notify the Shadow.GA administration and have it removed. You can suffer penalties for keeping your account insecure. Always make sure to use a secure password that you won't forget. This includes getting hacked.

- **Keep control of your IP.** The Internet Provider address you create an account and post with is your responsibility. If another account on the forum acts up, both accounts will receive penalties which may result in a ban. Possible siblings or users of the same Internet connection that use your account or create an account after you will also be your responsibility. This includes getting hacked.
