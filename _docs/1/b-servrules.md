title: 1b. Server guidelines
permalink: /docs/1/b-servrules/
---
Our server attempts to have the feeling of freedom and equality for all players. To keep that freedom, we must create rules that set the guidelines for right and wrong on our server.

Keep in mind that really obvious rules may not be stated here. Use common sense on the server at all times. You can get in trouble for something that isn't directly stated in a conduct policy.

## Bannable offenses
These offenses can result in a twenty-four-hour ban or greater.
They may also result in a suspension if repeated noticeably by the same player.

 - Purposely crashing or corrupting any world on the server in any way.
 - Mass griefing or "unrecoverable actions", mostly occurring in WorldEdit.
 - Flooding the server with chat messages, accounts, or using DDOS/DOS methods against the server.
 - Using harmful hack client methods (crash books, forceop signs, etc.) against a player or the server.
 - Using harmful items (crash potions, crash chests, etc.) against a player or the server.
 - Posing or attempting to log in as admins or known players.
 - Using collected or "spambot" accounts (this includes accounts received from alt dispensers) to log in.
 - Bypassing a ban with an alternate account, and/or bypassing an IP ban with a proxy/VPS.
 - Referring or linking to malicious, pornographic, or hate content in chat (you can PM someone with their consent).
 - Committing rogue activity as a higher rank or administrator (this includes abuse, or breaking rules with knowledge).
 - Threatening real-life harm to yourself or another player (including suicidal threats and suicide notes).

## Temporarily bannable offenses
These offenses can result in a smite, verbal warning, or short-time ban if done lightly (ex. breaking only six
blocks in someone's build).
They may also result in a twenty-four-hour ban or greater (ex. griefing someone's build massively on purpose, or WorldEdit grief).

 - Griefing, damaging, or building on other's property (regardless if you repaired it or not).
 - Plagiarism of content and copying player's builds without their consent.
 - Advertising your server IP or a website in public chat.
 - Using "trolling" techniques on admins or other players.
 - Using a nickname that could offend someone else.
 - Any act of racism, sexism, or hate crimes (offending a lot of people could result in suspension).
 - Falsely reporting other players or attempting to frame a player (including admins).
 - Comments that are potentially sexist, racist, homophobic, or directed to offend or anger a player known on the server (hatred towards a player or their religion/beliefs counts).
 - Teleporting players without their permission. This also includes modifying another player's tptoggle.
 - Violating the privacy of others by teleporting to them or their builds.
 - Announcing the IP (Internet Provider) address of any admin or player in public chat, or in message without the owner of that IP's consent.
 - Using offensive tags or nicknames designed to anger or offend (a good example would be using "FuckAllAdmins"), or nicking others without their permission.
 - Tampering with the inventories of other players without their permission, or spamming inventories with items.
 - Changing the WorldEdit limit without permission from an admin.
 - Begging for an administrative rank.

## Allowed
These actions are allowed unless told otherwise by an administrator.

 - Curse and/or swear, this server is welcome to all ages therefore we do not censor worded profanity.
 - Build artistic nudity and demonstrations of intercourse if it's mentioned as NSFW (not safe for work).
 - Publicly role-playing on the server (only if you're not spamming).
 - Using hacked mods and clients that are not harmful to other players or the server.
 - Using a proxy or VPN to cloak your IP (only if you're not bypassing IP ban).
