Our forum attempts to have the feeling of freedom and equality for all members. To keep that freedom, we must create rules that set the guidelines for right and
wrong on our server.

Keep in mind that really obvious rules may not be stated here. Use common sense on the forum at all times. You can get in trouble for something that isn't directly stated in a conduct policy.

#### Don't spam or power-post.
Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason. Try not to make whole new posts simply for the sake of adding on to something you posted earlier. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses (people usually make a post to say 'yeah' or agree with somebody). If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading.

#### Don't make discussions with the wrong tag.
Flarum uses a tag system so members know which posts are about what. This allows somebody with specific knowledge to answer posts quickly and filter out what they don't want to read. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant. Don't add irrelevant tags to attract people's attention, your post may end up getting deleted.

#### Don't start spam discussions.
This would be a discussion simply made for the sake of spamming, also known as shitposting. Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Threads like these will be removed.

#### Don't hijack threads.
Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on.

#### Don't evade server perm-ban.
If you were subject to a server perm-ban then you may not create an account. Remember, anyone (an account or not) can read documentation. Don't make an account just to plead with admins in hope that they'll unban you. That won't happen.

#### Don't evade a forum ban.
Making a new account when you have already been banned from the forum is not allowed. We will delete your account anyways, so what's the point? There is none.

#### Don't plagiarize.
If you don't already know the definition, plagiarism is copying someone else's work and calling it your own. Posts can be deleted for plagiarism.

#### Adhere to copyright.
Don't post anything against copyright law on the forum. We are based in the United States, so we follow U.S. law. Your post will be removed if it violates copyright and (if needed) you will be reported to the proper authorities.

#### Keep control of your account.
The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. If your account is hijacked, it is your responsibility to notify the Shadow.GA administration and have it removed. You can suffer penalties for keeping your account insecure. Always make sure to use a secure password that you won't forget. This includes getting hacked.

#### Keep control of your IP.
The Internet Provider address you create an account and post with is your responsibility. If another account on the forum acts up, both accounts will receive penalties which may result in a ban. Possible siblings or users of the same Internet connection that use your account or create an account after you will also be your responsibility. This includes getting hacked.
