You can connect to our server by typing or pasting the domain "shadow.ga" into your direct connect box. You may also add the server to your multiplayer list. No port is required to connect.

If your custom client or script requires entry of the port, using `25565` will result in a dead connection error. You must use the port `25890` if needed.
The server accomplishes this by using SRV records, which rid of the requirement to use ports for connecting to the game in order for a more user-friendly experience.
