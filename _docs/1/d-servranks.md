To enforce the server rules, we have set up a small group of server administrators.
They are given administrative tools, such as banning and grief logging, to keep the server from going out of control.
The default rank can apply for these ranks once they meet the requirements.
The power of each rank is listed from lowest (top of the page) to most powerful (bottom of the page).

Operator is the default rank.
Every player obtains this rank automatically upon login.
They are given commands similar to an operator on a vanilla Minecraft server, such as free gamemode and building tools like WorldEdit.

## Super Admin
Super Admins are the basic administrators.
They are given banning and smiting abilities, and full access to grief logging plugins.
Super Admins are also allowed to use some commands that are blocked to operators, such as `/tpo` and `/say`.

## Telnet Admin
Telnet Admins are given the same commands as Super Admins, however they can use telnet.
Our telnet server allows members with the rank to administrate even when they are not on Minecraft.
This is useful for on-the-go devices such as phones, which have apps supporting telnet.

## Senior Admin
Senior Admins have all the abilities as the above ranks.
They are also given extra commands that are blocked to the default admin rank, such as global commands like `/time` and `/weather`.
The Senior Admin rank is also required for non-applicable ranks, such as Executive and Developer.

## Developer Admin
Developers do exactly what it says, develop for the server.
They are in charge of making needed modifications to plugins and services.
Developers are also given access as collaborators on the GitHub organization page, allowing them to edit projects.
<br>
There are only four Developer Admins, and one Lead Developer.
<br>
_Admins for this rank are hand-picked._

## Executive Admin
Executives are in charge of all other admin ranks, except for the owner.
They have the ability to suspend disobedient or rogue administrators, and even ban them if required.
They are also in charge of marketing the server to players when the owners are unable to.
<br>
There are only four Executive Admins.
<br>
_Admins for this rank are hand-picked._

## Server Owner
The owners are in charge of the whole server.
They can make decisions like adding and removing plugins, adding and removing non-applicable ranks, and even redesigning the whole server if wanted.
The Server Owner is the highest level of administrator in the rank system.
<br>
There is only one owner.
