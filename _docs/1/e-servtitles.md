Titles are decorative or status symbol ranks given to members for an achievement, previous rank, or contribution to the server.
Unlike ranks, titles are not shown in-game and do not give permissions.
Members of any rank can obtain a server title and they are given to players by the owner.
It is possible to obtain multiple titles.

## Title of Donator
The Title of Donator is given to any member that makes a donation to our server.
To obtain this title, a member must donate any amount (no matter how small) to us.
There is no limit to how many players can obtain this title.

## Title of Veteran
