We have different types of worlds so operators may choose the environment they would like their build in.

## Switching worlds
Worlds can be switched by any member.
To do this, we have the command `/world`, which allows you to specify different types of worlds to visit.
Most worlds have a custom alias command that teleports you there. Different types of worlds can be accessed by different types of members.

### The Flatlands
The flatlands is the default world you spawn in.
You can build anything anywhere in this world, and it wipes every month to prevent lag.
<br>
You can access this region with `/flatlands`.

### The Roughlands
The roughlands is very similar to the flatlands except there are rough biomes, such as trees and oceans.
This world is only wiped along with the netherlands and roughlands.
<br>
You can access this region with `/roughlands`.

### The Netherlands
The netherlands is the nether world for anyone to join in.
There is lava and a large amount of netherrack, which is not wiped often.
This world is only wiped along with the roughlands and enderlands.
<br>
You can access this region with `/nether`.

### The Enderlands
The enderlands is the opposite of the netherlands.
It houses end stone and end villages as of the 1.9 update, and is also known as the place where you can slay the ender dragon.
This world is only wiped along with the roughlands and netherlands.
<br>
You can access this region with `/ender`.

### The Adminworld
The adminworld is a private world that only Super Admins and above can go in.
It is never wiped, and houses the adminworld village.
On occasion, an admin can invite someone as a "guest", allowing them to join the adminworld for a small amount of time until the server restarts.
When operators are not invited as guests, it is impossible for them to enter this world.
<br>
Admins can access this region with `/adminworld`.
