title: 1f. Appealing a ban

Most bans are permanent and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal if you ever need to be unbanned in advance.

## What's needed for an appeal
You can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

* You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
* An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided that this ban was not accidental).
* You have been framed by another member.
* You have been range banned (when parts of an IP have been blacklisted and it includes your location).
* You have been temporarily banned and it has exceeded 24h, or someone has not purged the banlist yet.
* The offense committed was minor and did not deserve a ban.
* An administrator has told you to make a ban appeal.

## Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.

If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, it may be a permanent ban. You cannot appeal a permanent ban.
