Our server uses a custom resource pack that gives builders the ability to add more detail in their creations.
We recommend that all players have it installed.

## Obtaining the resource pack
If the server does not notify you to install the resource pack automatically, you can download and apply it manually.
The resource pack is an open-source project and we use GitHub for easy editing and the ability to quickly male changes.
This means that you can obtain the newest version from your browser using the below link.

_To download the resource pack, click [this link](https://github.com/shadowga/resourcepack/archive/master.zip)._

## Installing the resource pack
After successfully downloading the resource pack, you will notice that it is in a zipped file.
To properly load the resource pack, we must unzip it.
Open the zipped file that you downloaded and extract it.
Inside the extracted file, there will be a folder called "resourcepack-master".
You may now move the folder into your Minecraft installation like any other resource pack.

## Activating the resource pack
When the resource pack is installed, you can activate like all other resource packs in the Minecraft options.
It may take up to a minute for your game to initialize the textures, and then you should be returned to the options menu.
You have now completed all the steps and your resource pack should be fully working as you join any server.
