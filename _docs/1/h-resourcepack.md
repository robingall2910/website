Our server uses a custom resource pack that gives builders the ability to add more detail in their creations.
We reccomend that all players have it installed.

## Obtaining the resource pack
If the server does not notify you to install the resource pack automatically, you can download and apply it manually.
The resource pack is an open-source project and we use GitHub for easy editing and the ability to quickly male changes.
This means that you can obtain the newest version from your browser using the below link.

_To download the resource pack, click [this link](https://github.com/shadowga/resourcepack/archive/master.zip)._

## Installing the resource pack
After sucessfully downloading the resource pack, you will notice that it is in a zipped file.
To properly load the resource pack, we must unzip it.
Open the zipped file that you downloaded and extract it.
Inside the extracted file, there will be a folder called "resourcepack-master".
You may now move this folder to your Minecraft installation and put it in the "resourcepacks" folder.
Make sure that you do not move the whole unzipped file but only the folder inside it containing the resource pack files.
The location of your Minecraft installation varies by your computer and operating system.
After moving the folder into the correct place, your resource pack copy should be installed.

## Activating the resource pack
When the resource pack is installed, it should appear under the available resource packs list.
You can activate it by going into the "resource pack" option in your Minecraft settings.
Make sure the resource pack is present and add it to the list of selected packs.
We advise that you don't mix this pack with others as it may not work correctly.
After you have activated the resource pack, click "done".
It may take up to a minute for your game to initialize the textures, and then you should be returned to the options menu.
You have now completed all the steps and your resource pack should be fully working as you join any server.

As we said above, this is an open-source project so the administration team welcomes any suggestions and we will try our best to help if you are expirencing difficulties.
