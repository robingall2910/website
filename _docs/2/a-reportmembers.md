If a certain member or a group of people are breaking the rules or bothering you on purpose, you have the right to report them.
We allow anyone to file a member report with a quick and easy form.
This application asks the names of the members, what they did, and if possible why you think they did it so administrators can effectively handle the situation.
After filling out a report, it will be read and an administrator will be assigned to the problem.

We also manage our admin team, so if an administrator has been abusing or has done something out of like you can report them as well.
Your admin-related report will be taken into the hands of our executive administrators to assess the issue at hand.
Keep in mind that falsely reporting an admin is a punishable offense.

## What's needed for a report
* The member or admin must be clearly violating our forum or server conduct policy.
* Any offense the member made must be worthy of a report (remember, an administrator has to read it and deal with it themselves).
* Reasoning behind the member's actions if possible and how it affects you.
* A clear account of what happened.
* Willingness to speak with an administrator to further explain yourself if needed.
* Assurance that (in your mind) you think your report is accurate.

## Filing a member report
As mentioned above, you can report members by filling out a form.
To refrain from communication restraints, we ask that you provide contact information (Discord account preferred).
