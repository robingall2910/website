If you're in need of support, we're here for you.
Support is a big deal to us and we provide several resources for getting help.
Before considering any of these options we recommend you try to ask an admin in-game first.

## Get help on Discord
Sometimes an admin may busy or not on the server.
For problems like this we have a Discord server and you can request an invite link by clicking the 'chat' button on our navigation bar.
Just like on our server, you can directly message someone on Discord if you prefer talking privately.

## Get help on the forum
Even with the above options, you may have a question that multiple people could answer or maybe you'd like it posted for a longer period of time.
To get forum support, all you need to do is make sure that you've got a forum account and ask a question on the forum paired with the ‘support’ tag.
An administrator will make an attempt to assist you as soon as possible.

You can also contact our server owner using the Discord handle `@Shadow#5973` if that floats your boat.
