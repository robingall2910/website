As an open-source server with operations public to everyone, we try to make reporting bugs and proposing suggestions fairly easy.
For this reason we have an online forum that allows other members to share their take on the issue or proposal.
This page outlines what to do if you are interested in shining light on an issue or suggesting something to make our server better.

### What an issue is
An issue is a fault in any system or a weakness not meant to be there.
This is different from a suggestion, where you are proposing a feature that doesn't exist already.
Issues can vary from already implemented features that aren't working to obvious errors in our server or forum.
This may also be referred to as a bug.

### What a suggestion is
A suggestion is something not yet implemented that you would like to see on here.
Usually people suggest big things like introducing a new feature, but people can also suggest small changes (even grammatical or cosmetic).
Suggestions may or may not be accepted depending on how much of a change they would make and how you could implement it.

### Taking action
To reveal an issue or suggestion, you may start a discussion on our forum.
If your discussion is about an issue, please use the 'development' tag paired with a proper sub-tag (server, forum, or resource pack).
If it's about a suggestion, use the 'suggestions' tag instead.
After your post is voted on by our administrator team, it can be accepted or denied by an Executive or above.
Here's what's required for revealing an issue or suggestion:
* You must have a forum account.
* You must make sure that nobody has made a discussion about your same topic.
* A clear description of the problem or what you want to suggest.
* If this is an issue, please ensure that the problem is reproducible.
* If this is a suggestion, please describe how your proposal would benefit us.

### Implementation
Most server-related changes are implemented by a developer, but some things may only require an addition or deletion to our library of plugins. Changes to our forum are usually made by modifying our extension list while website changes (still abbreviated under the 'forum' sub-tag) are made through the corresponding GitHub repository.
