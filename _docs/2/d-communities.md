Besides the server, our community mainly uses the forum and Discord server to get server-related information across.
Other communities help us promote ourselves while exploring the widely different member-bases of various places.

## What association is
Servers, Discord communities, and companies alike that have either reached out to us or have been specially requested as partnered by a server official are referred to as associated.
Being part of an associated community means the actions you make, whether positive or negative, reflect back to here.
If you wish to become part of an associated community, you must get to know their rules and respect their differences.

A list of associated communities can be viewed on our forum.
During situations, a specific community may be added or removed.
We attempt to keep a positive relationship with these communities.

## Associate your community
New communities yet discovered by our members can always be added to our list through an association request.
The acceptance of a request can depend on multiple factors, but we have guidelines for associated communities that defines our expectations.

### What we look for
* The service must have some common interest with our server or website; and be helpful to the members of our community.
* Any well-established audience, base of users, or target demographic relevant to our purpose.
* Protection against content that could possibly break our guidelines or cross ethical boundaries of this server.
* Providing an extension, beneficial third-party service, or tool to our members is encouraged.
* A similar administrative structure with moderation and a set of rules that point out what is right and wrong.

### Request association
To request association, you must have an administrative title or be the leader of the community you want to associate.
You can make a request to associate by contacting the server owner and your offer will be considered over time.
