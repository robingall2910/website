To assure quality and consistency, we have some guidelines for the usage of our content.
These branding rules can help members make their own contributions and allow others to incorporate the design into their service.

### Using the logo
Our vector logo is brought to you by the folks who made GitHub Octicons, a free and open-source set of icons.
The red flame shouldn't be warped, disfigured, or recoloured when used in association with our server and forum.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://shadow.ga/img/presskit/logo-small.svg"></div>

Usually, we use the red flame to represent both our name and brand.
The flame is almost always used in our specific red, `#c0392b` (hsl: `5,63,46` and rgb `192,57,43`).
You can use black, grey, or white if the logo can't be displayed in red.
