We're always keeping our eye out for potential administrators as the server grows.
While there are different ranks of admin, they all have one thing in common and that is to be reliable and helpful.
This is why candidates for the position are hand-picked based on how they present themselves to everyone.

## What we look for
* The ability to act mature and professional in difficult situations.
* Maintained control over problems when put under heavy stress by other members.
* Knowledge of our rules and helpfulness to inexperienced newcomers.
* Activity and membership on all of our platforms (on and off the server).
* The tendancy to stay out of trouble and remain honest at all times.
* Members who go out of their way to improve other people's experiences.
* Good communicators, people who know the English language well and can talk to people clearly.

## Selecting members
If you're already an administrator, you can elect a member for the position.
Elected members are expected to stand out from everyone else and meet all of the above requirements.
By electing a member, you bring them to an Executive or higher's attention and they will decide if your recommendation seems fit for the job.

### Requirements for election
* An administrator can only elect one member per year.
* The member must have all qualities of our selection checklist (shown above).
* The member must have had a forum account for thirty days (unless told otherwise by an Executive or higher).
* The member must know the conduct policy and documentation and stay up to date on recent information.
* The member must have not been banned (accidental bans don't count) on the server or forum for at least twenty days.
* The member must have a Discord account connected to the chat server.

### How to elect a member
To choose a member, they must agree to become an admin and vow to fulfill all tasks expected of them.
Once you have chosen someone you want to select, you can directly message an Executive or higher and they will make a decision.
