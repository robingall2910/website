Super Admin can be applied for by the default rank but there are requirements that have to be met to obtain Super Admin.

## Requirements
* You must have had a forum account for thirty days (unless told otherwise by an Executive or higher).
* You must know the conduct policy and documentation.
* You must have not been banned (accidental bans don't count) on the server or forum for at least twenty days.
* You must have a Discord account connected to the chat server.
* You must have an adequate understanding of the English language (use proper spelling and grammar).
* You must be willing to devote time to the server.

## Applying
Super Admin can be applied for by filling out a short and quick form.
After that form is completed, your application will be read and reviewed.
If we approve your application, the forum account you used in the form will be added to admin.
