Besides the server, our community mainly uses the forum and Discord server to get server-related information across.
Other communities help us promote ourselves while exploring the widely different player-bases of various places.

## Associated communities
Servers and their communities that have reached out to us or have been specially requested as associated by a server official are referred to as associated.
Being part of an associated community means the actions you make, whether positive or negative, reflect back to here.
If you wish to become part of an associated community, you must get to know their rules and respect their differences.

A list of associated communities can be viewed on our forum.
During situations, a specific community may be added or removed.
We attempt to keep a positive relationship with these communities.

## Unofficial communities
Some places may be popular with our staff or players but are not considered associated for different reasons.
Despite this, we still make them noticed by listing them as unofficial communities.
Unofficial communities are not directly linked to this server, and events that happen there will likely not be relevant here.

A list of unofficial communities can be viewed on our forum.
During situations, a specific community may be added or removed.
We attempt to remain positive with these communities but do not enforce any relationship.
